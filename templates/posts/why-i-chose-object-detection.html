        <h1>Why I Chose Object Detection for My Startup üöÄ</h1>

        <p>
            When you‚Äôre bootstrapping a startup‚Äîno funding, no PR, no overhyped demo videos‚Äîyou‚Äôve got
            to be obsessed with the problem you‚Äôre solving. For me, that obsession is object detection.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bigger Picture of AI</h2>
        <p>
            AI is fundamentally about mimicking human abilities‚Äîwhether it's understanding and
            generating language through models like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language
            Models (LLMs), generative agents, or creating content through synthetic media and prompt
            engineering. These advancements show how far we've come in replicating human language
            understanding and communication. But language is just one piece of the puzzle.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What about vision‚Äîhuman vision?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Just as we interpret the world visually‚Äîidentifying objects, understanding scenes,
            recognizing patterns‚Äîcomputer vision enables machines to do the same. That‚Äôs where object
            detection comes in. It‚Äôs a core function that brings AI systems closer to interacting with
            and understanding the physical world in meaningful ways.
        </p>

        <h2>What Is Object Detection?</h2>
        <p>
            In simple terms, object detection is the process of identifying <strong>what</strong> is in
            an image and <strong>where</strong> it is. Think bounding boxes, labels, confidence scores.
        </p>
        <p>Real-world examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-driving cars recognizing pedestrians and traffic signs</li>
            <li>Drones searching for survivors in disaster zones</li>
            <li>Medical systems detecting tumors</li>
            <li>Retail stores tracking shopper movement and product placement</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A Personal Spark: Road Crack Detection</h2>
        <p>
            My first real exposure to object detection wasn‚Äôt through a course or tutorial‚Äîit was
            through a company we hired to use road imagery and assess pavement quality. They trained
            models to analyze photos and detect cracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was fascinated. Although cracks aren‚Äôt discrete objects, detecting them meant diving into
            defect detection and semantic segmentation. Rather than draw boxes around "things," it meant
            highlighting pixel-level irregularities.
        </p>
        <p>
            This led me into the world of data science. I learned about dataset preparation, annotation,
            confidence scoring, and model evaluation. Eventually, that spark evolved into completing my
            Master‚Äôs degree in Data Science and Analytics.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Object Detection?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>It‚Äôs visually tangible</strong>: You can literally see the output and debug
                intuitively.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>It applies beyond traditional ‚Äúobjects‚Äù</strong>: Anomalies and patterns are
                just as important.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Edge deployment is a big win</strong>: I‚Äôm excited about AI that runs offline on
                Jetson Nano, Coral, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>It's under-commercialized</strong>: Especially in B2B, industrial, and smart
                infrastructure spaces.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Model (So Far)</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I‚Äôm starting with <strong>Mask R-CNN</strong>, using
            <strong>PyTorch</strong> and <strong>Detectron2</strong> (by Facebook AI). I chose it
            because it‚Äôs flexible, open-source, well-documented, and supports segmentation right out of
            the gate.
        </p>

        <h2>What I‚Äôm Working On Right Now</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Training Mask R-CNN on a small custom dataset</li>
            <li>Testing YOLOv8 vs. Detectron2 for real-time inference</li>
            <li>Building a fast annotation tool for labeling video frames</li>
            <li>Deploying test models on Jetson Nano and benchmarking latency</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Startup Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Object detection is at the core of what I want to build. It‚Äôs not just fun‚Äîit‚Äôs useful. From
            smart road monitoring to small factory inspection systems, I believe real-world vision AI
            still has untapped potential in niche, underserved domains.
        </p>

        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>AI isn‚Äôt just about language‚Äîvision matters too.</li>
            <li>Object detection enables machines to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the world.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôm starting with real use cases, not hype-driven gimmicks.</li>
            <li>Tools like Detectron2 help me move fast, and learn faster.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What‚Äôs Next</h2>
        <p>
            Next up: my tech stack breakdown ‚Äî from code to cloud. I‚Äôll be sharing how I‚Äôm stitching
            together tools, frameworks, and hacks to build my first MVP.
