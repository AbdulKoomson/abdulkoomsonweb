        <h1>Accelerated Machine Learning & Cloud Deployment in Excel</h1>

        <p>
            Today, I joined a webinar focused on
            <strong>Accelerated Machine Learning Fitting and Seamless Cloud Deployment</strong> using
            <strong>Analytic Solver Data Science</strong>. What stood out the most? The power of
            building and deploying real machine learning workflows‚Äîdirectly from Excel.
        </p>

        <h2>üîç Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Find Best Model:</strong> Automatically evaluate and compare multiple models for
                prediction and classification with a single click.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Science Workflow:</strong> From feature selection to model fitting, the
                entire machine learning lifecycle happens within Excel‚Äôs familiar interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Multi-stage Data Mining:</strong> Users can manage multiple steps‚Äîpreprocessing,
                training, and testing‚Äîall from one workbook.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deployment to Rason.com:</strong> With the built-in wizard, you can export
                trained models to <a href="https://www.rason.com" target="_blank">Rason.com</a> and
                access them via REST APIs. Templates are also available to speed up integration.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üß™ The Live Demo: Loan Dataset Classification</h2>
        <p>
            The webinar demo used the <strong>Loan Dataset</strong> from Kaggle to show how
            classification trees work inside Analytic Solver. Features included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tree Pruning:</strong> Easily adjustable parameters to reduce overfitting.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Simulation Tab:</strong> Allows scenario testing and prediction across various
                input combinations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tree Visualization:</strong> Full graphical breakdown of the decision-making
                process.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>‚ú® Synthetic Data Generation</h2>
        <p>
            Another highlight was the ability to generate
            <strong>synthetic datasets</strong>‚Äîparticularly useful when working with imbalanced data or
            needing to scale up for testing without access to large real-world datasets.
        </p>

        <h2>üéì My Personal Use & Experience</h2>
        <p>I‚Äôve previously used Analytic Solver in coursework for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear Programming & Optimization</li>
            <li>Risk Simulation</li>
            <li>Queuing Models</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            But this was my first exposure to its Data Science functionality, particularly for
            classification and model evaluation. Seeing the REST API and deployment workflow in action
            really opened my eyes to its potential.
        </p>

        <h2>‚úÖ Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            All in all, the webinar showed how machine learning‚Äîand even cloud deployment‚Äîis becoming
            more approachable, thanks to tools like Analytic Solver. If you‚Äôre an Excel power user or
            data science student looking for a low-code way to prototype, test, and deploy models, this
            might be worth checking out.
        </p>

            Have any experience with Analytic Solver or other Excel-based ML tools?
            <a href="mailto:abdulkoomson@gmail.com">Shoot me an email</a>‚ÄîI'd love to chat.

            <strong>Coming up next:</strong> I'll will be sharing some file from the course work
            mentioned above.
