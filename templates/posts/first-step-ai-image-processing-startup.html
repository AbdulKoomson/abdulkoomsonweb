        <h1>The First Step of My AI Image Processing Startup</h1>

        <p>Every startup starts somewhere—and for an AI-driven image processing platform, the first crucial step is
            giving users the ability to upload and access images securely from anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>That’s why I’ve built and launched the foundational infrastructure for global image upload using
            <strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong>. My current app enables users to upload image files to the cloud via a
            clean frontend and a secure backend API—paving the way for model inference at scale.</p>

        <h2>🌐 The App Is Live</h2>
        <p>The upload system is up and running at:</p>
        <p>
            👉 <a href="https://dearwebservices-hjg7d6exgmenaggw.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">
                https://dearwebservices-hjg7d6exgmenaggw.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net/
            </a>
        </p>

        <p>This backend connects directly to an Azure Blob container, giving me cloud-based storage that’s globally
            accessible and ready for model integration. Uploads are fast, stable, and persistent.</p>

        <h2>🧱 Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>While it might seem simple, setting up a robust and scalable image upload flow is a foundational move for any
            global AI image processing system. It ensures that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Images can be uploaded securely from any location</li>
            <li>They’re stored in a format that supports batch or real-time ML processing</li>
            <li>The frontend/backend flow is production-ready for future users</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>💻 What I Built</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A web-based <strong>frontend</strong> with form controls for image uploads</li>
            <li>A <strong>Flask backend API</strong> to handle uploads and route them to Azure Blob</li>
            <li>Blob configuration with secure connection string, container setup, and file access rules</li>
            <li>Testing with multiple file types and concurrent uploads</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🧪 It’s Already Proven</h2>
        <p>Even though I’m only posting this now, the service has been live for a few months—and it’s been running
            flawlessly. No spam, no crash loops, no broken endpoints. It’s stable and ready for the next phase.</p>

        <h2>🤖 What’s Next? Machine Learning Models</h2>
        <p>If you’re here expecting ML output, hang tight. The models are coming. Right now, I’m focused on building the
            infrastructure and data flow that will power those models.</p>
        <p>Processing, prediction, and intelligent analysis all depend on clean inputs and scalable infrastructure—and
            that’s what this milestone enables.</p>

        <h2>📦 Why Azure Blob?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Global availability zones</li>
            <li>Easy integration with Flask, FastAPI, and Azure ML</li>
            <li>Built-in scalability and secure file access</li>
            <li>Low cost for storage + great documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>💬 Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Startups aren’t just about flashy demos—they’re about building the pipes behind the scenes. This image upload
            system is the first major piece of my AI platform, and it lays the groundwork for everything else that’s
            coming.</p>

        <p>Check out the live demo, and stay tuned for the next step: connecting the uploaded images to a live object
            detection model. It's coming soon.</p>
