        <h1>Welcome to My Startup Journey ðŸš€</h1>

        <p>Hey there, and welcome!</p>

        <p>
            This is where Iâ€™m building in public. Iâ€™m launching an object detection startup completely
            from scratch â€” no venture capital, no hype cycles, and definitely no safety nets. Itâ€™s just
            me, a bunch of code, endless learning, and the constant cycle of iteration.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're into AI, machine learning, data science, product building, or youâ€™re simply
            curious about the behind-the-scenes grind of startup life â€” you're in the right place.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Build in Public?</h2>
        <p>
            Simple: transparency keeps me accountable and offers real value to others who may be walking
            a similar path. Instead of hiding behind stealth mode, Iâ€™ll be documenting every step â€” the
            good, the bad, and the ugly.
        </p>

        <p>Expect weekly updates on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Model experiments and results</li>
            <li>Architecture decisions</li>
            <li>Product feedback (both wins and faceplants)</li>
            <li>My personal notes on staying motivated (especially when GPUs fail at 2 a.m.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Can Expect Here</h2>

        <p>This blog is basically my open journal. I'll be sharing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python modules and notebooks â€” how I leverage various packages and frameworks</li>
            <li>
                Steps I'm taking to grow this startup â€” product design, user feedback, growth strategies
            </li>
            <li>Daily blogs I read, seminars I attend, and the discussions that shape my thinking</li>
            <li>
                Content across data science, data engineering, coding, AI, ML, BI, and past startups
            </li>
            <li>The evolving tech landscape, innovation trends, and exploratory experiments</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Funny enough, I donâ€™t have a personal social media account that I actively use. So, I
            designed this site to be my own personal feed â€” a place to share updates, engage, and
            collaborate.
        </p>

        <h2>Join the Ride</h2>

        <p>
            Iâ€™m not pretending to have all the answers. This is an experiment in both AI and
            transparency. If you're curious about object detection, startup building, or just want to
            peek behind the curtain, I invite you to follow along. Comment, share your thoughts, ask
            questions â€” letâ€™s learn together.
        </p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by. The fun (and chaos) is just getting started.</p>
