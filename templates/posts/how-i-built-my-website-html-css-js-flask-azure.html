        <h1>How I Built My Website with HTML, CSS, JS, Flask, and Azure Blob Storage 🌐</h1>

        <p>
            AbdulKoomson.com is the fifth website I've built—and easily the most functional. It started
            as a basic static site but has grown into a Flask-powered platform with backend integration
            using Azure Blob Storage to serve files and projects.
        </p>

        <h2>👨‍💻 My Web Development Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Several years ago, I took a beginner-friendly frontend development course. It taught me the
            basics: structure with HTML, styling with CSS, and interactivity with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, I built two simple demo websites. Nothing fancy—just enough to grasp the core
            concepts. Since then, I’ve built <strong>five websites</strong>. Two are currently live
            (which I’ll share in an upcoming post), and my first live project went online about three
            years ago.
        </p>

        <h2>🔧 Tech Stack Behind AbdulKoomson.com</h2>

        <h3>Frontend – HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            I hand-coded the site using semantic HTML, styled it with custom CSS, and used JavaScript
            for basic interactivity. It’s responsive, lightweight, and fast—no frameworks or
            dependencies, just clean markup.
        </p>

        <h3>Backend – Flask</h3>
        <p>
            I integrated Flask to serve dynamic content and route project file downloads. Flask’s
            simplicity makes it ideal for personal sites and prototypes, and it pairs well with
            Python-based workflows.
        </p>

        <h3>File Sharing with Azure Blob Storage</h3>
        <p>
            To store and serve downloadable resources (like project samples and templates), I use
            <strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong>. Through the Azure SDK’s <code>BlobServiceClient</code>,
            my Flask app connects to Azure and dynamically fetches files for users.
        </p>
        <p>
            This keeps the site lightweight and scalable—no large files on the server, just clean blob
            references.
        </p>

        <h2>📘 Quick Primer: HTML, CSS & JS</h2>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of any web page. It defines the structure
            of the content—headings, paragraphs, buttons, forms, links, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls how that content looks. It’s responsible for colors,
            fonts, layout, and responsiveness across devices.
        </p>

        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript adds behavior. Want to show/hide something, validate a form, or update content
            without reloading the page? JS handles that magic.
        </p>

        <h2>🚀 What’s Next?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Build an admin portal with Flask for blog publishing</li>
            <li>Pull project metadata dynamically from Azure</li>
            <li>Launch a public download section for open-source code</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Don’t underestimate the power of starting with the basics. HTML, CSS, and JS laid the
            foundation, and Flask + Azure took it further. This setup gives me full control over both
            frontend and backend with zero dependencies on heavy CMSs.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're just starting your web dev journey, I highly recommend building your own portfolio
            site from scratch. It’s the best way to truly understand how the web works.
        </p>
