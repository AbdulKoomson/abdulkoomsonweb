        <h1>Designing My Startup Logo with AI and Online Tools üé®</h1>

        <p>
            Today I set aside time to brainstorm and experiment with visual ideas for my startup logo.
            Since branding is such an important part of product identity, I wanted to explore multiple
            tools and creative directions before locking anything in.
        </p>

        <h2>üß† Tools I Explored</h2>
        <p>Here are the platforms I tried out during this logo discovery session:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.design.com" target="_blank">Design.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.looka.com" target="_blank">Looka.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.wix.com/logo/maker" target="_blank">Wix Logo Maker</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://logo.com" target="_blank">Logo.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT Logo Prompting</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>‚ú® Standout Results: Design.com & ChatGPT</h2>
        <p>
            Out of all the platforms, the two that stood out the most for me were
            <strong>Design.com</strong> and <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Design.com</strong> provided a clean UX and lots of presets that matched the
            aesthetic I‚Äôm aiming for. Meanwhile, ChatGPT offered a unique approach‚Äîletting me generate
            and modify icon ideas using text prompts. This felt surprisingly creative and flexible.
        </p>

        <h3>üìù The Logo Prompt I Used on ChatGPT</h3>
        <p>Here‚Äôs the prompt I used to guide ChatGPT‚Äôs logo concept generation:</p>
        <p>
            üëâ
            <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6862951d-3db8-800f-b5c9-89028cd6b59a" target="_blank">View Shared Prompt
                & Logo Output</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The results were promising, and the ability to iterate visually through prompt tweaks helped
            me explore options quickly without feeling locked into one direction.
        </p>

        <h2>üñºÔ∏è Logo Drafts & Demo Folder</h2>
        <p>
            I saved some of the generated logo ideas in my local <code>/demo/collection</code> folder.
            I‚Äôll share final versions and iterations once I lock in the core brand visual style.
        </p>

        <h2>üß† A Quick Study on Pixels & Logo Creativity</h2>
        <p>
            To better understand digital design fundamentals, I read an article on pixels, resolution,
            and digital graphics over at Fotor:
        </p>
        <p>
            üëâ
            <a href="https://www.fotor.com/blog/what-is-a-pixel-and-how-to-use-it/" target="_blank">
                What is a Pixel and How to Use It?
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This gave me a better appreciation for the building blocks of any image‚Äîand will help me
            give clearer direction when working with designers or AI tools in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>üí¨ Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Designing a logo isn‚Äôt just about slapping a symbol next to a name‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating
            something meaningful and memorable that reflects your brand's mission. I'm getting closer to
            that with each iteration, and this creative process has been more fun than I expected.
        </p>

        <p>
            I‚Äôll be sharing my top 3 logo candidates and decision process in an upcoming post. Until
            then, feel free to check out my early outputs and prompt if you're also exploring visual
            branding for your own project.
